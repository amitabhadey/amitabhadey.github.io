Hi, I'm Amit. I am a Lecturer at the <a href="https://compsci.uncg.edu/">Department of Computer Science<a> at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Previously, I completed my Masters' in Computer Science with a concentration in Big Data and Data Science from the <a href="https://uncg.edu/">University of North Carolina at Greensboro</a> and my Bachelors in Computer Science from <a href="https://cse.sds.bracu.ac.bd/">BRAC University</a>. I was a graduate research student at the IFFS-ML lab, advised by <a href ="https://sites.google.com/uncg.edu/shan-suthaharan/home">Dr. Shan Suthaharan</a>. My masters' dissertation project is titled LDEB: Label Digitization with Emotion Binarization and Machine Learning for Emotion Recognition in Conversational Dialogues. As an undergrad, I was advised by <a href="https://cse.sds.bracu.ac.bd/faculty_profile/69/dr_amitabha_chakrabarty">Dr. Amitabha Chakrabarty</a> and my thesis was titled Fake News Pattern Recognition using Linguistic Analysis.

# My work and research

I specialize in large language models (LLMs) and my work generally focuses on developing computational models and training them so that it can understand and generate human language with high level of precision. The two major domains of my research is tackling the challenges of deploying misinformation preventing measures and improving conversational AI. 

My research delves into the realm of multimodal analysis, encompassing text, images, videos, and audio, develop models that can understand the context surrounding a piece of content, including historical context, user demographics, and network dynamics to develop context awareness of models, and also explores cross-lingual and cross-cultural aspects of misinformation, ensuring that detection models can be applied globally and adapted to diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

I study approaches to enhance emotion recognition in conversational AI systems by understanding the complexity of human emotions, especially within nuanced dialogues, which requires complex hybrid models that combine deep learning techniques with traditional machine learning that can accurately perceive and respond to users' emotional states. My work This has direct implications for improving user experiences in AI-driven applications, from virtual assistants to mental health support systems.
