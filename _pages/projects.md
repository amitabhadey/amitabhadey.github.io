<p>This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on textual data using Python, leveraging the VADER Sentiment Scoring method, the RoBERTa pre-trained model, and the Transformers pipeline. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words, which can be particularly useful for understanding the sentiment in social media posts, customer reviews, and other text data.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Implement VADER Sentiment Scoring: Use VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) to perform sentiment analysis on text data. VADER is designed for social media texts and provides a simple yet effective method for obtaining sentiment scores.</li>
<li>Utilize RoBERTa Pre-trained Model: Implement sentiment analysis using the RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach) pre-trained model, which is known for its high performance in NLP tasks.</li>
<li>Apply the Transformers Pipeline: Use the Transformers pipeline from Hugging Face to streamline the process of loading pre-trained models and performing sentiment analysis.</li>
</ol>
