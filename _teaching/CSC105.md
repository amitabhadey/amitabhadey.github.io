## Course Modification Disclaimer 

This syllabus is intended to give the student guidance on what may be covered during the semester and will be followed as closely as possible. However, as the instructor, I reserve the right to modify, supplement, and make changes as course needs arise. I will communicate such changes in advance through in-class announcements and in writing via this website.

## Late Policy and Makeup Exams

[Borrowed from <a href = "https://www.uncg.edu/employees/stephen-tate/">Dr. Stephen R. Tate</a>]

Assignments are due at 11:59 PM on the due date and may be turned in up to 7 calendar days late with a 25% late penalty. Students with planned absences, whether for university events, religious observance, or other reasons, are expected to make arrangements with the instructor to turn in assignments or take exams before the scheduled date of the assignment or test. No assignment will be accepted more than 7 calendar days after the original due date.

Exam/test dates will be announced at least two weeks in advance and may be made up only if it was missed due to an extreme emergency and arrangements are made before the exam date. Exams may not be taken early or late due to personal travel plans.

Note: Canvas submission will automatically get locked past the deadline. Late submission must be made via email with a proper Subject Title and valid explanation. All submissions made past 11:59 PM of the due date will be regarded as late submissions. To avoid any technical difficulty, you must try to submit the assignment a couple of hours in advance at the very least. To be fair to the rest of the students, no excuses will be accepted.

## Generative AI

[Borrowed from <a href = "https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/">Dr. Chris Kanich</a>]

You will almost certainly be using GenAI (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Grammarly, etc) in some way for the rest of your career. You are encouraged to use whatever GenAI tools you would like to complete the assignments and final project in this class.

While these tools are amazing, please do not use their existence as an excuse to procrastinate on getting started with your assignments. They are good, but they aren’t that good.
While you can use GenAI on your homework, using autocomplete and copy-paste until the tests pass is not acceptable. You must understand any code that you use. We reserve the right to review your submitted code with you, and if you cannot explain the code you submitted, it will be considered a violation of the academic integrity code equivalent to plagiarism (see below).

Please remember that in-class assessments (quizzes and exams) are a comparatively large portion of your grade, and you cannot use GenAI on them. This policy is subject to change as we all learn more about how GenAI works and doesn’t work as part of learning college-level course content.

## Academic Integrity Policy

Assignments are clearly labeled as collaborative or solo, which indicates whether you can discuss the assignment with other students or not. In collaborative assignments, you may discuss the problem and solutions with other students and can help classmates debug their code. However, no code may be copied from either another student or from a website — all code submitted must have been written by you. If you do work with other students on collaborative assignments, you must put their names in a comment at the top of the file that you collaborated on. Solo assignments are just that – solo – and you may not discuss the assignment with anyone other than the instructor. If you need help during a solo assignment you can (and should!) contact the instructor for help, but cannot talk with another student or post something online seeking help. Sharing your own work is a serious violation of academic integrity, and if homework is copied then both the person who actually did the work and the person who copied it will be punished. Note that I use a plagiarism detection tool on submissions, and if your solution is too close to that of another student or of an online resource, you will be required to explain your solution and how you arrived at it.

Any incidents of academic dishonesty will be handled strictly, resulting in either a zero on the assignment or an F in the class, depending on the severity of the incident. Any cheating in an online exam, no matter how minor, will result in an automatic F in the class. Significant incidents will be reported to the UNCG Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. Note that the Department of Computer Science maintains records of all academic integrity incidents, and multiple violations, even in different classes or semesters, will always result in reporting to the university and serious penalties.

Students are expected to be familiar with and abide by the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy, which is online at https://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/. Academic Honor Policy will be strictly enforced. By submitting an assignment, each student is acknowledging their understanding and commitment to the Academic Integrity Policy on all major work for the course. Any infraction(s) will result in failure of the entire course and a reduced grade up to an F. Any incidents of academic dishonesty will be handled strictly, resulting in either a zero on the assignment or an F in the class, depending on the severity of the incident. Significant incidents will be reported to the UNCG Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. Note that the Department of Computer Science maintains records of all academic integrity incidents, and multiple violations, even in different classes or semesters, will always result in reporting to the university and serious penalties.

## Attendance Policy
Attendance will not be taken in class, and is voluntary; however, all students are responsible for everything done or said in class (this can include changes in assignments, due dates, etc.). It is highly unlikely that a student who regularly misses classes will be successful in the course. If you are going to miss a lecture, you need to notify the instructor prior by sending an email following the format mentioned above. I am obligated to inform the department if a student is missing classes frequently. If you find yourself repeatedly unable to attend lectures for health reasons, you may want to apply for accommodations.

Please see UNCG Attendance Policy for more information.

## Canvas Announcements
Communication includes Announcements in Canvas, and individual emails. You should be ready to RECEIVE the following types of messages. You will receive regular communication via the Announcements in the course Canvas site that are intended for all students regardless of your group. Check these each time you access the course in Canvas to be sure you are up to date with the latest information (these are time stamped so if you know when you logged in last, you can determine if anything is new).

## Accommodations/ADA Statement
UNCG seeks to comply fully with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Students requesting accommodations based on a disability must connect with the Office of Accessibility Resources and Services (OARS) in 215 Elliott University Center, (336) 334-5440, oars.uncg.edu.

The University of North Carolina at Greensboro respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds and abilities. If you encounter any barriers to full participation in this course due to the impact of a disability/condition impacting a major life activity, please contact the Office of Accessibility Resources and Services (OARS). OARS will engage students in an interactive process to determine the need for any reasonable accommodations.

Connect quickly via a brief Welcome Form. Upon receipt, OARS will contact you to schedule a convenient, virtual consultation. You may also request a consultation by calling (336) 334-5440, emailing oars@uncg.edu, or walking into the OARS suite in 215, EUC. Additional OARS info may be found at oars.uncg.edu.
