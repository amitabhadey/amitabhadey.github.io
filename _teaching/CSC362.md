Course Modality: This course is structured as an entirely in-person experience and is not intended for asynchronous participation. If attending lectures in person is not feasible for you, it is advisable to reconsider enrolling in this class. Attendance is a critical component of the course, as there are points allocated specifically for being present.

## Course Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of the C programming language, including control structures, data types, and memory management.
- Gain proficiency in using terminal commands for navigation, file manipulation, and environment management.
- Master Git workflow and commands for effective version control, including branching, merging, and repository management.
- Learn the principles of dynamic memory allocation and debugging techniques to resolve issues like memory leaks and dangling pointers.
- Explore the compilation process, including preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking, along with static and dynamic linking techniques.
- Develop skills in interprocess communication using pipes, shared memory, and process synchronization techniques.
- Analyze and implement thread synchronization mechanisms, including mutexes, semaphores, and strategies for avoiding race conditions and deadlocks.
- Examine memory layout and management strategies, such as fragmentation handling and free block management.
- Understand basic network programming concepts, including socket programming, TCP connections, and protocol models.
- Learn cybersecurity fundamentals, including threat detection, encryption, and the implementation of protection mechanisms like firewalls and VPNs.

## Evaluation and Grading

To assess your understanding of the course material and your ability to apply the concepts, the grading structure will include 5 quizzes, 1 midterm exam, and 1 final exam. Each quiz will be worth 10%, collectively accounting for 50% of the total grade. The midterm and final exams will each contribute 20% to your grade, while the remaining 10% will be allocated to attendance and in-class participation.

Attendance is crucial—missing 5 classes will result in a deduction of 1 point per additional absence, up to a maximum of 10 points. Grades will be adjusted at the end of the semester to reflect the overall performance of the class.

Please note that no makeup exams will be provided, and quiz scores will not be dropped. Consistent performance throughout the semester is essential to achieve a strong final grade.
